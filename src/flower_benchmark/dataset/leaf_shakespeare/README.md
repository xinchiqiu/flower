## Quickstart
You may follow the instructions in the README.md file in the shakespeare directory.

For our case you may just run:
* ```cd shakespeare && ./preprocess.sh -s niid --sf 1.0 -k 0 -t sample -tf 0.8``` (full-sized dataset)<br>
* ```cd shakespeare && ./preprocess.sh -s niid --sf 0.2 -k 0 -t sample -tf 0.8``` (small-sized dataset)
